# What I made

- Icon:-

I made the icon using Adobe Illustrator. I followed the google's material style to create the icon. I downloaded the logo from OSGeo's website and edited it to a reshaped logo.


- Splash Screen:-

Here I created an animated gif for the splash screen using Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop. I downloaded the png file of the logo and animated it in after effects and then used photoshop to export as a gif. Then I used some of the external libraries to ad the gif to imageview and holded the activity using countdown timer for 3 seconds before going to the next activity.


- Home Page with Projects:-

I made the page using recyclerView. Firstly I created a layout for a single project. Then I joined it to the recyclerView. I made a different file for project names and added a few of the projects to it as the api is not available. The code was like taking the count of the projects and displayed them one by one. Also I paired the correct image with the correct title. Then I added onclickListener to the imageview so as to get to the correct login page as it was required to.


- Login Page for OSGeo-Track and Github:-

There was not much action in the login pages, almost all of it was just designing it. I took a few references from the internet for the designs that I could possibly make. I had a little bit experience in CSS so it was easy to understand how to do that. I made different files for text background, page background and the login button. Also I created variables for colors that were same color was used in multiple things.

## What I learned

It was my first experience making an android app. I knew java but i had to make the app in kotlin so it was a little bit difficult at first but then it looked like better than java for making apps. I also learned a lot about git and using git on android studio for updating the repositories. There were very few online tutorials but they were sufficient.

## Difficulties I faced

I faced a lot of difficulties. the first difficulty I faced was updating the repository using git in android studio. Android Studio had something wrong so whenever I made a commit to the repository, it just deleted all the code that I wrote. Fortunately, I had made its backup. The next issue I faced was to create a separate click command for different projects I added to the homepage of the app. It took me around 3 days to figure out how to do it. Moreover the api was not available so it was very difficult to find information regarding the tools i was using in android studio and there are very few tutorials that follow kotlin and not java. The overall difficulty I faced was running android studio on a 7 year old computer. I had to upgrade the ram of my computer. That's all.
