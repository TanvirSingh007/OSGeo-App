I added a few of the projects directly to the app directory temporarily as the api is not available. Also I made the page using recyclerView.

## What I learned

It was my first experience making an android app. I knew java but i had to make the app in kotlin so it was a little bit difficult at first but then it looked like better than java for making apps. I also learned a lot about git and using git on android studio for updating the repositories. There were very few online tutorials but they were sufficient.

## Difficulties I faced

I faced a lot of difficulties. the first difficulty I faced was updating the repository using git in android studio. Android Studio had something wrong so whenever I made a commit to the repository, it just deleted all the code that I wrote. Fortunately, I had made its backup. The next issue I faced was to create a separate click command for different projects I added to the homepage of the app. It took me around 3 days to figure out how to do it. Moreover the api was not available so it was very difficult to find information regarding the tools i was using in android studio and there are very few tutorials that follow kotlin and not java. The overall difficulty I faced was running android studio on a 7 year old computer. I had to upgrade the ram of my computer. That's all.
